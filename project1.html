                        <p class="section-text">In the academic world, on-campus employment has become an essential need for college students. Gaining work experience and earning extra income while pursuing a degree is a top priority. However, securing on-campus part-time jobs has proven to be a challenging endeavor. At the University of Michigan, there is currently no dedicated platform for on-campus part-time job listings.</p>

                            <li><strong>Tedious Job Tracking: </strong> The current process relies on students tracking job postings through email, a cumbersome task that often leads to neglect or forgotten opportunities.

                            <li><strong>Transparency and Response Time: </strong> The current system lacks transparency, with extended response wait times, resulting in students losing interest in the job application process.

                                <p> The project commenced with market research to understand how students currently discover on-campus job opportunities. The research revealed that 55% of students rely on email or face-to-face interactions, and 49% of institutions use new student orientation to showcase job options. Interviews with students were also conducted to comprehend their motivations and experiences related to on-campus employment.</p>

                                <p>The design process involved creating personas based on key research findings. Two primary personas emerged: students and employers. This step facilitated the development of user stories, user flow, and the Question of Change (QOC) diagram, which aided in organizing ideas, aligning them with user needs, addressing the problem, and achieving the design goals.

                                The "M-Job Hunt" project will has a transformative impact on the University of Michigan community, both for students and employers seeking on-campus part-time jobs. The following key impacts can be highlighted:
                                <ol>
                                    <li> <strong>1. Enhanced Transparency: </strong> Students can now monitor the status of their applications, reducing uncertainty and frustration. This has led to a more engaging and positive experience for all users. </li>
                                    <li> <strong>2. Streamlined Job Discovery: </strong> By centralizing job listings and providing an easy-to-navigate platform, students now have a convenient and efficient way to explore and apply for jobs across all university departments and schools. </li>
                                    <li> <strong>3. Improved User Experience: </strong> Students can now easily search for jobs based on their preferences and track their applications. Employers can efficiently post openings, engage with potential candidates, and receive valuable student feedback.</li>
                                    <li> <strong>4. Efficient Communication: </strong> The platform fosters better communication between students and potential employers. The addition of features like the "Interest Board" and the job-related forum has created a space for students to showcase their interests and gain insights about job opportunities from former student employees.</li>
                                </ol>
