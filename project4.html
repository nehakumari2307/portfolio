                        <p class="section-text">The University of Michigan's LSA Transfer Bridges program is dedicated to supporting prospective students from Michigan community colleges seeking to transfer to U-M Ann Arbor's College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA) for their undergraduate degrees. The program offers individualized support, academic advising, social experiences, and connections to U-M faculty. The overarching vision is to expand outreach by reaching more community colleges across Michigan and growing the program in the coming years. </p>
                        <div class="title"> Problem Statement</div>
                        <p class="section-text">
                            Address the challenges of increasing outreach to more community college students by enhancing the workflow of the Transfer Bridges team.</p>

                        <ol class="section-text">
                            <li><strong>1. Budget Constraints: </strong> Limited financial resources made it challenging for the program to hire additional advisors and program managers, leading to advisors taking on project management roles, which further strained their capacity.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>2. Overwhelmed Program Staff: </strong> The team frequently grappled with an overwhelming volume of daily emails from students inquiring about the transfer process, prerequisites, advising slot bookings, and more.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>3. Virtual Engagement: </strong> The transition to virtual sessions from in-person workshops held at various Michigan community colleges resulted in a diminished experience, impacting the program's ability to attract potential students. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class="title"> Solution</div>
                        <div class="section-text">In response to these challenges, the following solutions were proposed to improve the outreach and workflow:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>1. FAQ Autoreply Email Template: </strong> The implementation of an autoreply email system featuring a frequently asked questions (FAQ) template. This template would address the most common queries, alleviating the strain on program staff and offering quicker responses to students.</li>
                                <li><strong>2. Video Snippets: </strong> The addition of video snippets to the program's website homepage. These videos would comprehensively explain the transfer process, requirements, and how students can effectively utilize the program, ensuring that vital information is readily accessible to prospective students.
                                <li><strong>4. Expand Virtual Engagement: </strong> To compensate for the diminished in-person experience, consider enhancing virtual engagement options, such as webinars, interactive Q&A sessions, and virtual campus tours. These initiatives will make the program more attractive and informative for prospective students.</li>
                                <li><strong>3. CRM Software Integration: </strong> Implementing customer relationship management (CRM) software to automate tracking and follow-up tasks for potential students.</li>

                                    that talks about requirements for transfer, how to navigate the process, and answers
                                    a few general questions. Another recommendation is to integrate CRM software which
                                    helps reducing the manual work of tracking and following up on potential students.
                                    Lastly, have an automated email when students sign-up for an advising session with
                                    resources and common FAQs to prepare students beforehand.</p>

                                    <li>3. Develop an online community or forum where prospective and current transfer students can connect, share their experiences, and seek advice. This will foster a sense of belonging and provide valuable peer-to-peer support.
