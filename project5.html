                            <li><strong>1. Audience Identification: </strong> Identifying the right target audience within the wellness domain posed a challenge during the survey study. Given the broad scope of wellness, defining and reaching the specific user base was a complex task.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>2. Scope Definition: </strong> As wellness is a vast domain, narrowing down the evaluation scope for comparative analysis was crucial. Ensuring that the analysis provided valuable insights required focus within a specific domain.

                            <li><strong>3. Time Constraints: </strong> Due to time limitations, A/B testing, which could have provided a more in-depth analysis, could not be conducted on the website. Such testing would have allowed for a thorough examination of user behavior and preferences.

                                <p>The type of usability testing adopted for Choose Improve was Summative Testing. This approach was chosen because the product was already developed.
